# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! Here, I share my solutions to the daily programming puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## üìÇ Repository Structure
Each day of Advent of Code corresponds to a folder named `Qx` (e.g., `Q1`, `Q2`, etc.). Inside each folder, you'll find:

- `x.py` : My solution to the problem.
- `input.txt`: The puzzle input provided by Advent of Code.

Feel free to explore the code to see how I approached and solved each problem!

## üöÄ Usage
If you'd like to run my solutions using your own inputs, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshat1931/Advent-of-code-solutions.git
   ```
2. Replace the `input.txt` files in the folders with your own puzzle input. Advent of Code provides a unique input for every user.
3. Run the solution for the specific day. Example:
   ```bash
   python Q1/1.py
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary tools installed to run the solutions. For example, if solutions are written in Python:

- Python 3.8+

## ü§ù Contributing
If you find an issue or have an idea for improvement, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request!

## ‚≠ê Acknowledgment
